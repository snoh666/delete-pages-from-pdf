# pdf-file-manage
# Overview
Simple python scripts to manage pdf files, as Windows doesn't have free software to for example: split, extract, join different files.

# Usage

Each script has basic command line interface for you to input required information.
Filenames equal their usages so:
- `extract.py` extracts page or pages to different file
- `join.py` joins two different pdf files into one
- `separate.py` separates all pages into each file
